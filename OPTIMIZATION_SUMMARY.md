## 🔧 Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Ultra-Fast Utility Functions
```python
# Fast tensor normalization
def _normalize_input_fast(obs: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor

# Vectorized one-hot encoding  
def _batch_one_hot_encode_fast_jit(actions: torch.Tensor, component_sizes) -> torch.Tensor

# Fast content-based hashing
def _fast_tensor_hash(tensor: torch.Tensor) -> int
```

### 2. Tensor-Based Caching System
- Replaced slow dictionary caches with fast tensor-based lookups
- Pre-allocated tensor pools for memory reuse
- Integer-based cache keys instead of object IDs
- Cache hit/miss tracking for performance monitoring

### 3. Vectorized Operations
```python
# Single-pass computation of all policy heads
def _compute_all_heads_vectorized(self, trunk_features)

# Fast vectorized action masking with pre-computed indices  
def _apply_action_mask_vectorized(self, logits_list, action_mask)

# Direct Q-value computation without parallel overhead
def _compute_q_values_optimized(self, obs_batch, action_batch)
```

### 4. Optimized Forward Pass
```python
# Ultra-fast shared forward pass
def _forward_shared(self, batch: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]

# Vectorized baseline computation
def _compute_baselines_optimized(self, obs_dict, actions, structure_learns)
```
